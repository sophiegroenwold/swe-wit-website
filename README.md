SWE collaboration with DPHS WIT (Women in Technology) club to create the WIT website.

*Welcome WIT members!*<br>
Right now, you're viewing the `swe-wit-website` repository under the `swe-wit` organization. 

This is the *remote* version of the repositiory, but when you make changes to it, you'll be working on your *local* computer. You'll then *push* your changes to the remote version that you see here, which goes live at [swe-wit.github.io](http://swe-wit.github.io) using Github Pages.<br>

*Git commands you'll want to use:*<br>
* `git clone [SSH key]`: downloading the version of the repository you see here onto your local computer.<br>
* *if your local repository is ahead of the remote repository,* push your changes using these commands:<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  `git add .`<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  `git commit -m "[your message here]"`<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  `git push origin master`<br>
* `git pull origin master`: *if the remote repository is ahead of your local repository,* use this command to pull the changes.<br>
